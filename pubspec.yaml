# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GR
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GilroyRegular.ttf
          weight: 400

    - family: GM
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GilroyMedium.ttf
          weight: 500

    - family: GB
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GilroyBold.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: GEB
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GilroyExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800

    - family: GH
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GilroyHeavy.ttf
          weight: 900
